# --------------------
# plot management of the optimal solution of our policy scenario: !! considering the represented forest area by plot !!

# example for all single regimes 
# --------------------


# general, I recommend to look at the ggplot cheat sheet to get ideas how to plot
# this is a powerful package for making plots! https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/

# For data handling and aggregation I recommend the dyplr cheatsheet https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-transformation.pdf

# But of course google is also all the time a good help, but the sheets can give an idea what to look for

single_regime_prc <- df.solution %>%

  # This is simply stand_share * by represented_area_by_NFIplot
  # reason: stand_share can be < 1, which means a stand where assigned two optimal regimes, e.g. each with a share of 0.5

# NEXT step: Plot policy scenario together reference scenarios (df.refall)
#########################################################################################################

# Lets get a stacked management plot, where the four scenarios are next to each other

# There for the two data frames df.solution and df.refall need to be combine (rbind)
# But this requires that they have the same columns with identical names

names(df.solution)
names(df.refall)

unique(df.solution$scenario)
unique(df.refall$scenario)

# 1) take from df.refall only the columns that we need (id, year, regime, policy, scenario, represented_area_by_NFIplot, and so on), works with "select"
# from df.refall we also want to keep only one year, since the management is constant over time
# df.all_scenario <- df.refall %>%  select() %>% filter(year ...)

df.all_scenario <- df.refall %>% select(id, year, regime, policy, scenario, regime, represented_area_by_NFIplot)
df.all_scenario <- filter(df.all_scenario, year == "2021")


# 2) create a column called "stand_share", using "mutate" and give it the value of 1 since under the reference stands are fully managed by one regime

df.all_scenario <- mutate(df.all_scenario, stand_share = 1)


# create a column called solution area share, with "mutate", see e.g. under script 1-load_opt_data.R around line 149

df.all_scenario <- mutate(df.all_scenario, solution_area_share = round(stand_share * represented_area_by_NFIplot, digits=0))


# column year can now also be ignored since this is not in df.solution

df.all_scenario <- select(df.all_scenario,-c(year))


# relocating column before rbind

df.all_scenario <- df.all_scenario %>%
  relocate(stand_share, .after = regime) %>%
  mutate(regime_6class = regime)%>%
  relocate(regime_6class, .after = scenario) %>%
  mutate(regime_class = regime)%>%
  relocate(regime_class, .after = regime_6class)


# when you are having the same columns in both sets you can combine them with rbind

df.all_scenario <- rbind(df.all_scenario, df.solution)


# Afterwards you calculate also the percentage shares and plot them, e.g. like above form line 93 onward with the stacked version. 


# calculation of percent shares
